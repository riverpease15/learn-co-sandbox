      "Gryffindor/Slytherin": "Like Harry Potter himself, your allegiances definitely lie with Gryffindor, but Slytherin may be a better fit for you than you’d originally think. Your passion for adventure, excitement, and new experiences means that Gryffindor is the perfect place for you. You are fiercely loyal to your closest friends – sometimes even to a fault – and the recklessness and optimism that comes with being a Gryffindor combined with the ambition of Slytherin will ensure that you go far in life.",
      "Gryffindor/Ravenclaw": "Just like Hermione Granger, you were ultimately placed in Gryffindor, but the Sorting Hat seriously considered putting you in Ravenclaw. You are a natural born leader, often taking control of the reins from others whose recklessness or dedication to facts and knowledge clouds their judgment. You are intelligent, but acknowledge that there are more important things in life, and therefore aim to use your intelligence and determination to fight for what you believe to be right.",
      "Gryffindor/Hufflepuff": "You have all the loyalty of a Hufflepuff, but your affinity for Gryffindor ensures that that loyalty is fierce: You would do almost anything for your loved ones, even if it has a negative effect on you personally. This means that your friends and family members often come to you when in need, but it’s also important to remember to spend time taking care of yourself. You wear your heart on your sleeve, and impulsively act on your emotions without fear of the consequences.",
      "Hufflepuff/Gryffindor": "You’re undeniably a Hufflepuff, but you definitely have some strong Gryffindor qualities. You proudly wear your heart on your sleeve, but you lack the recklessness of a true Gryffindor, which means that you don’t act on your feelings without thinking. Your kindness and openness is what originally attracts other people to you, but they stay for your unwavering loyalty, meaning you’re constantly surrounded by a large group of friends.",
      "Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw": "You belong in Hufflepuff without question, but your Ravenclaw-esque appreciation for knowledge means your many friends come to you when they need advice from someone with a level head. While you enjoy any kind of learning, working as part of a team is where you truly thrive. You are an excellent collaborator, and understand that communication with others is an essential part of learning and, more importantly, growing as a person.",
      "Hufflepuff/Slytherin": "People often consider the two to be polar opposites, but you are a rarity: a true Hufflepuff with some undeniably Slytherin traits. You strive for success, but would never sacrifice fairness in order to achieve it, which is why you truly belong in Hufflepuff house. Like all Hufflepuffs, you are incredibly hard-working, but you are also fiercely ambitious, meaning that you are successful in every task you set your mind to.",
      "Ravenclaw/Gryffindor": "You believe above all in the importance of wisdom, which is why you undoubtedly belong in Ravenclaw, but your sense of adventure means you may also have an affinity for Gryffindor house. You are a thrill-seeker – you love to travel and there’s nothing more exciting to you than new experiences – and believe that adventure is essential in the pursuit of knowledge. You are brave, but would never intentionally put yourself in danger, placing you firmly in Ravenclaw.",
      "Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff": "You definitely belong in Ravenclaw, but you have a kindness that sets you apart from most. While some Ravenclaws can be seen as slightly haughty or intimidating, your Hufflepuff side means you are more approachable, and therefore have an easier time making friends. Despite your softness, you find it easy to detach yourself from emotional situations and give objective viewpoints, making you the perfect person to go to for advice.",
      "Ravenclaw/Slytherin": "You are a Ravenclaw through and through, but your ruthless ambition means you may also fit well in Slytherin. Knowledge is incredibly important to you, and you love nothing more than learning new things, but your love of learning is undeniably motivated by your determination for success. Unlike some of your fellow Ravenclaws, you often avoid any task that requires teamwork, preferring to work alone.",
      "Slytherin/Gryffindor": "You are relentless in your pursuit of success, making you a perfect fit for Slytherin, but your willingness to take risks makes you somewhat compatible with the typical traits of Gryffindor house. People who don’t know you well are often intimidated by your reserved demeanour, and you have very few close friends. You are loyal to few, and definitely prioritise personal success over close relationships.",
      "Slytherin/Ravenclaw": "Your Slytherin ambition combined with a typically Ravenclaw-esque thirst for wisdom means you are destined to go far in life. People often consider you to be aloof and unapproachable – and they may actually be right – as your passion for knowledge and success far outweighs your need for close relationships. For you, true friendships are rare, but you are smart enough to hold onto those you deem worthy of your affection.",
      "Slytherin/Hufflepuff": "It is often said that Slytherin and Hufflepuff couldn’t possibly live in harmony, but you prove those people wrong: You belong without doubt in Slytherin house, but you have some undeniably Hufflepuff qualities hiding behind your detached demeanour. You can find it difficult to develop close friendships, but the people close to you know you’re a big softie at heart, and will do anything in your power – <i>anything</i> – to help them."
